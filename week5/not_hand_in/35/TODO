- CharInfo and Char should be inside of Charcount (this is probably the way to fix
 the internal header thing)
- Internal and public header files should be reshaped.
- use get() in the count function
- // ML: NAE, the class should also count and keep track of character frequencies
  // (stored in CharInfo).
- Maybe put d in front of them.
